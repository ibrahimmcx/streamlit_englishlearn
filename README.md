My first Streamlit experiment:
I developed my own Streamlit application to make learning English more interactive and fun: a vocabulary memorization and quiz platform. ðŸŽ¯

What I did in this project:

User login system and database management (using SQLite)

Flashcards and quiz system

Personalized progress tracking for users

Built the web application with Streamlit and powered it with Gemini API integration

Libraries I used:

Streamlit â€“ fast and interactive web interfaces

Pandas â€“ data management and analysis

Requests â€“ API communication

Gemini API â€“ interactive language learning features

ðŸ’¡ I just started this project, learned each step along the way, and gained a lot from the coding process.
